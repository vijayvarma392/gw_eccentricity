    """Measure eccentricity and mean anomaly from a gravitational waveform.

    Eccentricity is measured using the GW frequency omega22(t) = dphi22(t)/dt,
    where phi22(t) is the phase of the (2,2) waveform mode. We evaluate
    omega22(t) at pericenter times, t_pericenters, and build a spline
    interpolant omega22_pericenters(t) using those points. Similarly, we build
    omega22_apocenters(t) using the apocenter times, t_apocenters. To find the
    pericenter/apocenter locations, one can look for extrema in different
    waveform data, like omega22(t) or Amp22(t), the amplitude of the (2,2)
    mode. Pericenters correspond to pericenters, while apocenters correspond to
    apocenters in the data. The method option (described below) lets you pick
    which waveform data to use to find extrema.

    The eccentricity is defined using omega22_pericenters(t) and
    omega22_apocenters(t), as described in Eq.(1) of arxiv:xxxx.xxxx.
    Similarly, the mean anomaly is defined using the pericenter locations as
    described in Eq.(2) of arxiv:xxxx.xxxx.

    FIXME ARIF: Fill in arxiv number when available. Make sure the above Eq
    numbers are right, once the paper is finalized.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    tref_in:
        Input reference time at which to measure eccentricity and mean anomaly.
        Can be a single float or an array.

    fref_in:
        Input reference GW frequency at which to measure the eccentricity and
        mean anomaly. Can be a single float or an array. Only one of
        tref_in/fref_in should be provided.

        Given an fref_in, we find the corresponding tref_in such that
        omega22_average(tref_in) = 2 * pi * fref_in. Here, omega22_average(t)
        is a monotonically increasing average frequency that is computed from
        the instantaneous omega22(t). omega22_average(t) is not a moving
        average; depending on which averaging method is used (see the
        omega22_averaging_method option below), it means slightly different
        things.

        Eccentricity and mean anomaly measurements are returned on a subset of
        tref_in/fref_in, called tref_out/fref_out, which are described below.
        If dataDict is provided in dimensionless units, tref_in should be in
        units of M and fref_in should be in units of cycles/M. If dataDict is
        provided in MKS units, t_ref should be in seconds and fref_in should be
        in Hz.

    method: str
        Which waveform data to use for finding extrema. Options are:
        - "Amplitude": Finds extrema of Amp22(t).
        - "Frequency": Finds extrema of omega22(t).
        - "ResidualAmplitude": Finds extrema of resAmp22(t), the residual
          amplitude, obtained by subtracting the Amp22(t) of the quasi-circular
          counterpart from the Amp22(t) of the eccentric waveform. The
          quasi-circular counterpart is described in the documentation of
          dataDict below.
        - "ResidualFrequency": Finds extrema of resomega22(t), the residual
          frequency, obtained by subtracting the omega22(t) of the
          quasi-circular counterpart from the omega22(t) of the eccentric
          waveform.
        - "FrequencyFits": Uses omega22(t) and iteratively subtracts a
          PN-inspired fitting function from it, and finds extrema of the
          residual.
        Default is "Amplitude".
        Available list of methods can be also obtained from
        gw_eccentricity.get_available_methods().

        The Amplitude and Frequency methods can struggle for very small
        eccentricities (~1e-3), especially near the merger, as the secular
        amplitude/frequency growth dominates the modulations due to
        eccentricity, making extrema finding difficult. This is the main reason
        for using the residual methods,
        ResidualAmplitude/ResidualFrequency/FrequencyFits, which first remove
        the secular growth before finding extrema. However, methods that use
        the frequency for finding extrema
        (Frequency/ResidualFrequency/FrequencyFits) can be more sensitive to
        junk radiation in NR data.

        Therefore, the recommended methods are
        Amplitude/ResidualAmplitude/FrequencyFits.

    dataDict:
        Dictionary containing waveform modes dict, time etc.
        Should follow the format:
            dataDict = {"t": time,
                        "hlm": modeDict,
                        "t_zeroecc": time,
                        "hlm_zeroecc": modeDict, ...
                       },
        where time is an array with the same convention as tref_in, and
        modeDict should have the format:
            modeDict = {(l1, m1): h_{l1, m1},
                       (l2, m2): h_{l2, m2}, ...
                       }.

        "t_zeroecc" and "hlm_zeroecc" are only required for ResidualAmplitude
        and ResidualFrequency methods, but if they are provided, they will be
        used to produce additional diagnostic plots, which can be helpful for
        all methods. "t_zeroecc" and "hlm_zeroecc" should include the time and
        modeDict for the quasi-circular limit of the eccentric waveform in
        "hlm". For a waveform model, "hlm_zeroecc" can be obtained by
        evaluating the model by keeping the rest of the binary parameters fixed
        but setting the eccentricity to zero. For NR, if such a quasi-circular
        counterpart is not available, we recommend using quasi-circular
        waveforms like NRHybSur3dq8 or PhenomT, depending on the mass ratio and
        spins. We require that "hlm_zeroecc" be at least as long as "hlm" so
        that residual amplitude/frequency can be computed.

        For dataDict, we currently only allow time-domain, nonprecessing
        waveforms with a uniform time array. Please make sure that the time
        step is small enough that omega22(t) can be accurately computed; we use
        a 4th-order finite difference scheme. In dimensionless units, we
        recommend a time step of dtM = 0.1M to be conservative, but you may be
        able to get away with larger time steps like dtM = 1M. The
        corresponding time step in seconds would be dtM * M * lal.MTSUN_SI,
        where M is the total mass in Solar masses.

        The (2,2) mode is always required in "hlm"/"hlm_zeroecc". If additional
        modes are included, they will be used in determining the pericenter time
        following Eq.(5) of arxiv:1905.09300. The pericenter time is used to
        time-align the two waveforms before computing the residual
        amplitude/frequency.

    return_gwecc_object: bool
        If True, returns the eccDefinition object used to compute the
        eccentricity and mean anomaly. This can be used to make diagnostic
        plots.
        Default is False.

    interpolator: str
        Interpolation routine to compute omega22_pericenters(t) and
        omega22_apocenters(t). Currently there are two options to choose an
        interpolator from
        - "InterpolatedUnivariateSpline": scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline
        - "PchipInterpolator": scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator
        Default is "InterpolatedUnivariateSpline".

    interpolator_kwargs:
        Dictionary of arguments to be passed to the interpolator.  Defaults are
        the same as those of the chosen interpolator routine.

    extra_kwargs: A dict of any extra kwargs to be passed. Allowed kwargs are:
        num_orbits_to_exclude_before_merger:
            Can be None or a non negative number.
            If None, the full waveform data (even post-merger) is used for
            finding extrema, but this might cause interpolation issues.
            For a non negative num_orbits_to_exclude_before_merger, that
            many orbits prior to merger are excluded when finding extrema.
            Default: 1.
        extrema_finding_kwargs:
            Dictionary of arguments to be passed to the extrema finder,
            scipy.signal.find_peaks.
            The Defaults are the same as those of scipy.signal.find_peaks,
            except for the "width" parameter. "width" denotes the minimum
            separation between two consecutive pericenters/apocenters. Setting
            this can help avoid false extrema in noisy data (for example, due
            to junk radiation in NR). The default for "width" is set using
            phi22(t) near the merger. Starting from 4 cycles of the (2,2) mode
            before merger, we find the number of time steps taken to cover 2
            cycles, let's call this "the gap". Note that 2 cycles of the (2,2)
            mode is approximately one orbit, so this allows us to approximate
            the smallest gap between two pericenters/apocenters. However, to be
            conservative, we divide this gap by 4 and set it as the width
            parameter for find_peaks.
        debug:
            Run additional sanity checks if debug is True.
            Default: True.
        omega22_averaging_method:
            Options for obtaining omega22_average(t) from the instantaneous
            omega22(t).
            - "mean_of_extrema_interpolants":
              The mean of omega22_pericenters(t) and omega22_apocenters(t) is
              used as a proxy for the average frequency.
            - "interpolate_orbit_averages_at_extrema": First, orbit averages
              are obtained at each pericenter by averaging omega22(t) over the
              time from the current pericenter to the next one. This average
              value is associated with the time at mid point between the
              current and the next pericenter. Similarly orbit averages are
              computed at apocenters. Finally, a spline interpolant is
              constructed between all of these orbit averages at extrema
              locations. Due to the nature of the averaging, the final time
              over which the spline is constructed always starts half an orbit
              after the first extrema and ends half an orbit before the last
              extrema.
            - "omega22_zeroecc": omega22(t) of the quasi-circular counterpart
              is used as a proxy for the average frequency. This can only be
              used if "t_zeroecc" and "hlm_zeroecc" are provided in dataDict.
            Default is "mean_of_extrema_interpolants".
        treat_mid_points_between_pericenters_as_apocenters:
            If True, instead of trying to find apocenter locations by looking
            for local minima in the data, we simply find the midpoints between
            pericenter locations and treat them as apocenters. This is helpful
            for eccentricities ~1 where pericenters are easy to find but
            apocenters are not.
            Default: False.

    Returns:
    --------
    tref_out/fref_out:
        tref_out/fref_out is the output reference time/frequency at which
        eccentricity and mean anomaly are measured. If tref_in is provided,
        tref_out is returned, and if fref_in provided, fref_out is returned.
        Units of tref_out/fref_out are the same as those of tref_in/fref_in.

        tref_out is set as
        tref_out = tref_in[tref_in >= tmin & tref_in < tmax],

              tmin = max(t_pericenters[0], t_apocenters[0]),
        As eccentricity measurement relies on the interpolants
        omega22_pericenters(t) and omega22_apocenters(t), the above cutoffs
        ensure that we only compute the eccentricity where both
        omega22_pericenters(t) and omega22_apocenters(t) are within their
        bounds.

        fref_out is set as
        fref_out = fref_in[fref_in >= fmin & fref_in < fmax],
        where fmin = omega22_average(tmin)/2/pi and
              fmax = omega22_average(tmax)/2/pi, with tmin/tmax same as above.

    ecc_ref:
        Measured eccentricity at tref_out/fref_out. Same type as
        tref_out/fref_out.

    mean_ano_ref:

        tref_out/fref_out.
