# Welcome to gw_eccentricity
**gw_eccentricity** provides methods to measure eccentricity and mean anomaly
from gravitational wave signals.

These fits are described in the following paper: <br/>
[1] FIXME.

If you find this package useful in your work, please cite reference [1] and
this package.

This package lives on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/gw_eccentricity), is compatible with
python3, and is tested every week. You can see the current build status of the
main branch at the top of this page.
