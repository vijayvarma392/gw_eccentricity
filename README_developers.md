## Adding a new eccentricity definition
For adding a new definition of eccentricity follow the guidelines [here](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/gw_eccentricity/wiki/Adding-new-eccentricity-definitions)

## Waveform data
Follow the instructions in `data/README.md`

## PyPI release
Note: Currently, only Vijay and Arif can do this, as they are the only ones with maintainer access to the PyPI package.
1. Update the version number at the top of gw_eccentricity/gw_eccentricity.py and commit all changes. This version number gets propagated to setup.py.
2. Do the following to release the new version:
```shell
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```
## Create Conda recipe
**NOTE:** This is needed to be done only once to add the recipe to conda-forge/staged-recipe.
To update the conda release follow conda release section below.
1. Generate `conda` recipe using `grayskull` since we already have the PyPI package.
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge grayskull
grayskull pypi gw_eccentricity
```
2. Clone https://github.com/md-arif-shaikh/staged-recipes, a fork of
   https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes.
3. Move the `meta.yaml` file generated by `grayskull` to `gw_eccentricity`
   directory under `recipe`.
4. Fix the `python` version under requirements, e.g., `python >=3.6`
5. Update recipe-maintainers.
