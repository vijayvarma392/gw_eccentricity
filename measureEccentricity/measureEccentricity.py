    """Measure eccentricity and mean anomaly at reference time.

    parameters:
    ----------
    tref_in:
        Input reference time at which to measure eccentricity and mean anomaly.
        Can be a single float or an array. NOTE: eccentricity/mean_ano are
        returned on a different time array tref_out, described below.

        If dataDict is provided in dimensionless units, then tref_in should be
        in units of M. If dataDict is provided in MKS units, tref_in should be
        in seconds.

    fref_in:
        Input reference frequency at which to measure the eccentricity and
        mean anomaly. It can be a single float or an array.
        NOTE: eccentricity/mean anomaly are returned on a different freq
        array fref_out, described below.

        If dataDict is provided in dimensionless units, then fref_in should be
        in units of cycles/M. If dataDict is provided in MKS units, then
        tref_in should be in Hz.

        Given an fref_in, we find the corresponding tref_in such that,
        omega22_average(tref_in) = 2 * pi * fref_in.
        Here, omega22_average(t) is a monotonically increasing average
        frequency that is computed from the instantaneous omega22(t).
        Note that this is not a moving average; depending on which averaging
        method is used (see the omega22_averaging_method option below),
        it means slightly different things.

        Currently, following options are implemented to calculate the
        omega22_average
        - "average_between_extrema": Mean of the omega22 given by the
            spline through the peaks and the spline through the troughs.
        - "orbital_average_at_extrema": A spline through the orbital
            averaged omega22 evaluated at all available extrema.
        - "omega22_zeroecc": omega22 of the zero eccentricity waveform
        The default is "average_between_extrema". A method could be passed
        through the "extra_kwargs" option with the key
        "omega22_averaging_method".

    dataDict:
        Dictionary containing waveform modes dict, time etc.
        Should follow the format:
            {"t": time, "hlm": modeDict, ...}
            with modeDict = {(l1, m1): h_{l1, m1},
                             (l2, m2): h_{l2, m2}, ...
                            }.
        Some methods may need extra data. For example, the ResidualAmplitude
        method, requires "t_zeroecc" and "hlm_zeroecc" as well in dataDict.

    method:
        Method to define eccentricity. See get_available_methods() for
        available methods.

    return_ecc_method:
        If true, returns the method object used to compute the eccentricity.
        Default is False.

    spline_kwargs:
        Dictionary of arguments to be passed to
        scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline.

    extra_kwargs: Any extra kwargs to be passed. Allowed kwargs are
        num_orbits_to_exclude_before_merger:
            Can be None or a non negative real number.
            If None, the full waveform data (even post-merger) is used to
            measure eccentricity, but this might cause issues when
            interpolating trough extrema.
            For a non negative real num_orbits_to_exclude_before_merger, that
            many orbits prior to merger are excluded when finding extrema.
            Default: 1.
        extrema_finding_kwargs:
            Dictionary of arguments to be passed to the peak finding function,
            where it will be (typically) passed to scipy.signal.find_peaks.
        debug:
            Run additional sanity checks if debug is True.
            Default: True.
        omega22_averaging_method:
            Methods for getting average omega22. For more see fref_in.
            Default is "average_between_extrema".
        treat_mid_points_between_peaks_as_troughs:
            If True, instead of trying to find local minima in the
            data, we simply find the midpoints between local maxima
            and treat them as apastron locations. This is helpful for
            eccentricities ~1 where periastrons are easy to find but
            apastrons are not.
            Default: False

    returns:
    --------
    tref_out/fref_out:
        tref_out is the output reference time where eccentricity and mean
        anomaly are measured and fref_out is the output reference frequency
        where eccentricity and mean anomaly are measured.
        Units of tref_out/fref_out is the same as that of tref_in/fref_in. For
        more see tref_in/fref_in.

        NOTE: Only of these is returned depending on whether tref_in or
        fref_in is provided. If tref_in is provided then tref_out is returned
        and if fref_in provided then fref_out is returned.

        tref_out is set as tref_out = tref_in[tref_in >= tmin && tref_in < tmax],
        where tmax = min(t_peaks[-1], t_troughs[-1]),
        and tmin = max(t_peaks[0], t_troughs[0]). This is necessary because
        eccentricity is computed using interpolants of omega22_peaks and
        omega22_troughs. The above cutoffs ensure that we are not
        extrapolating in omega22_peaks/omega22_troughs.
        In addition, if num_orbits_to_exclude_before_merger in extra_kwargs
        is not None, only the data up to that many orbits before merger is
        included when finding the t_peaks/t_troughs. This helps avoid
        unphysical features like nonmonotonic eccentricity near the merger.

        fref_out is set as fref_out = fref_in[fref_in >= fmin && fref_in < fmax].
        where fmin is the frequency at tmin, and fmax is the frequency at tmax.
        tmin/tmax are defined above.

    ecc_ref:
        Measured eccentricity at t_ref. Same type as t_ref.

    mean_ano_ref:
        Measured mean anomaly at t_ref. Same type as t_ref.

    ecc_method:
        Method object used to compute eccentricity. Only returne if
        return_ecc_method is True.
